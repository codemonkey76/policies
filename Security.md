# ASG Communications Customer Network and Security Tools Policy

## Introduction

At ASG Communications, we strive to provide reliable and secure services to our customers. While we take measures to ensure the security of our infrastructure, customers are responsible for the security of their networks and related systems. This policy outlines customer responsibilities and provides guidance on the importance of network security.

## Customer Responsibilities

### Network Security

Customers agree to accept responsibility and liability for the security of and/or access to their networks and related systems. You must take reasonable and appropriate precautions to prevent any violations of your network and/or related systems security. ASG Communications does not take responsibility or liability in any way for any violations of your network and/or related systems security, however caused.

### Security Measures

While ASG Communications is responsible for the provision of your service, you are responsible for ensuring that adequate security in the form of virus protection and firewalls exists to protect your electronic data and computer operating system against unauthorized or unwarranted intrusion.

## Importance of Security Software

Security software plays a critical role in protecting your computer and data from various threats, such as:

* Viruses

	Security software helps deliver protection that stops most viruses, such as Trojans and worms, before they can infect your computer.

* Spyware

	Security software can help prevent cybercriminals from hacking into your computer and stealing your personal information, such as passwords.

* Information & Identity Theft

	Security software can help protect you from software that may self-install on a computer or be installed as a hidden component of another program. These programs generally enable information to be gathered secretly about what websites you visit, your passwords, etc.

* Online Predators

	Security software can monitor your children's website and social network activity, as well as block access to inappropriate material/websites where required.

## Security Software Recommendations

ASG Communications does not recommend any one piece of security software, as everyone's needs are different. Customers are encouraged to research and select security software that best suits their specific requirements.
