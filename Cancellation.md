# Account Cancellation

Due to the telecommunications consumer protection code, only the verified Account Holder can close the account.

There are two ways to cancel the account - in all cases, the request must be made in writing:

The easiest way to cancel your account is to go to our [Cancellation page](https://asgcommunications.com.au/policies/cancel_my_account) and fill out the form. An email will be sent to the account holder for confirmation. Click the confirmation link in the email to verify you really want to cancel.
 
Or send an email to support from the registered Account Holder's email address with subject "Account Cancellation" and Message "Please close my account and disconnect all services."

If you have a credit balance, you can ask for a refund (see [Refund Policy](https://asgcommunications.com.au/policies/refund)). If you have any outstanding charges or applicable early contract termination fee, these will be invoiced within 30 days and are payable on receipt of the invoice.


Thank you for using ASG Communications, and we hope to see you again someday.
