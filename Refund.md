# Refund Policy

## Digital Online Services

Services such as Phone number ordering, features & add-ons that have been ordered and activated are non-refundable for change of mind. See below for refunds and exchanges on goods.

## Account Cancellation

If the customer wishes to discontinue the service and has a credit balance at the time of cancellation, we will refund the remaining balance of the customer's account back to their initial payment method. If the initial payment method is unavailable (for example, if the card is cancelled or expired), then government-issued ID will be required in order to process the refund and a processing delay of up to 30 days will apply.

A cancellation request must be made in writing by email or support ticket by the account holder. See Account Cancellation for more information.

If the customer has an active fixed term contract, an early termination charge will be added to the account and final invoice will be issued.

## Accidental Payments and Ad-hoc refunds

A credit balance can be refunded quickly and easily to the customer on request via the initial payment method. Simply contact support for more information. If the initial payment method is unavailable (for example, if the card is cancelled or expired), then government-issued ID will be required in order to process the refund and a processing delay of up to 30 days will apply.

## Credits on accidentally ordered digital add-ons

ASG Communications may, at their discretion, provide an account credit on accidentally ordered products. Please contact support for assistance.
